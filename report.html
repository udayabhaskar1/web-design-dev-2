<h2>Assignment Reflection:</h2>
<p>
    Before we started working on this project, we have gone through a series of group discussions to design the basic layout for the website. We researched multiple websites bearing the same theme and tried to learn and inculcate some good ideas by watching their designs. After we have gone through multiple brainstorming sessions, we finally had the ideas that we can implement into fruitful work.<br><br>
    We are to design a website for a Kids Fashion outlet. The dichotomy of working on a project like this is to implement two ideas at the same time. One idea is that we have to design a website for the kids and at the same time we have to make this website easily accessible to the parents. So, our target audience for this website is both the kids, as well as their parents. It is an interesting mix of ideas and we worked hard on how to implement these two ideas in the same webpage. For this we used colorful imagery to make it visually appealing to the kids, in addition to making the website more descriptive and responsive to the parents. We also had to add in multiple details regarding the planned expansions to the Fashion store, like the Café and the Fashion Events.<br><br>
    When the actual work on designing the website began, we split our tasks among each other. Our website had a total of 9 pages, and we split them evenly among us to work in an efficient manner. We assigned multiple tasks for each other. One of the team members was working on the scripting, and the other team members were working on the images, text CSS at the same time. And we interchanged our roles as it suited to our needs. And in the end it was a whole team work rather than an individual accomplishment. In fact, being a part of this project has taught us the importance of working in a group environment. It has been an enriching experience for all of us.<br><br>
    We also had multiple inputs on the usability testing, and based on that we tried to implement all of the suggestions that were made during this stage of design. All the workings on the various pages in the next section.<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Report of the workings of various pages/ Usability testing</h2>
<h3>Home page:</h3>
<p>We designed the Home page in a way that it is visually appealing to the kids as well as their parents by putting in colorful images of young kids in groups. Before the usability testing we only had one image on our home page. During the testing, there were inputs that we should add some more animation to make it even more appealing. Based on this, we added multiple images to the home page and created a slide show of images. We also included the play/pause button to make it more accessible to the user.</p>
<h3>About Us:</h3>
<p>We had feedback during the testing with respect to this page. Some of the testers felt that our 'About Us' page had a basic picture forms. So we added more diverse images to show contrasting style of fashion for the kids. </p>
<h3>Products:</h3>
<p>Our products page has been well appreciated during the usability testing. We used a flip image to show the details of various clothing. And when the user clicks on the image, an overlay pops up on the screen showing further description relating to the product. We made extensive use of Javascript to make the products page function the way we intended it to be.</p>
<h3>Services:</h3>
<p>The content in our services page was appreciated in the testing. But some of the users felt that the fun factor was missing. And we also felt like there was too much text being displayed to the user on the same page. So we made some changes to the design by implementing clickable 'drop-down' boxes using jQuery Accordion and letting the answer pop out only after the questions are clicked by the user.</p>
<h3>Caf&#233:</h3>
<p>Our Caf&#233 page has received good appreciation during the testing. The only further additions we had to make after the testing is to change the fonts and the colors of some of the text, and add in a couple of images. Using extensive use of imagery that supports the theme of a Caf&#233 is the method we chose to communicate with the user.</p>
<h3>Events:</h3>
<p>This is one of the pages that we had to redesign after the usability testing. We only had a basic table layout before the testing. We received inputs that we need to have a better way to showcase the various fashion events that are scheduled to happen in the coming months. So we used the images of kids walking on fashion ramp as the basic heading image for this page. Later we added images to showcase the events that were scheduled to happen based on their chronological order. We also added a Google plugin map to ensure easy accessibility to the user.</p>
<h3>F.A.Q:</h3>
<p>The inputs we received for the FAQ page were similar to that of the Services page. The content was appreciated, but a lot of text was showing on the web page. So we had to use the clickable text format to pop put the answers pertaining to each and individual questions. In this way, we made the FAQ page much more responsive than before.</p>
<h3>Contact Us:</h3>
<p>Our Contact Us page was designed in a way to provide basic information to the user. After the testing we made a few minor changes, like adding a google map and changing the font colors, to make it much more responsive. Our feedback form was well appreciated during the testing.</p>
<h3>Order Now:</h3>
<p>For the Order Now page, we always had the idea to allow the user buy multiple products and display the total price based on the number of items the user purchased. We used JavaScript to work through this process. If a user chooses the number of items he/she wishes to buy, we made it accessible by showing the total price of the items. We also have the option of displaying the total cost of all the items purchased by the user. Even the mode of payment was tweaked to allow the user with multiple options, in this case payment by credit card, debit card or PayPal. We also have the option of submitting a query or resetting the query should a user decide to do so.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>For the Order Now page, we always had the idea to allow the user buy multiple products and display the total price based on the number of items the user purchased. We used JavaScript to work through this process. If a user chooses the number of items he/she wishes to buy, we made it accessible by showing the total price of the items. We also have the option of displaying the total cost of all the items purchased by the user. Even the mode of payment was tweaked to allow the user with multiple options, in this case payment by credit card, debit card or PayPal. We also have the option of submitting a query or resetting the query should a user decide to do so.<br><br>
    In addition to the above mentioned details, we used multiple ways to make the website more responsive to the user. We used a clickable logo as a header to the website. We placed a “to top” button in the footer to allow the user easy access to go back to the top of the page. We used a search bar to making the searches easy. Overall, we designed this website to make it more responsive and easily accessible to the user.
